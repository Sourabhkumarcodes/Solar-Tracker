Developed an automated solar tracking system using an Arduino Uno board to maximize solar energy absorption. Implemented real-time tracking of the sunâ€™s position using Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs) and servo motors for dynamic panel adjustment. Enhanced efficiency by ensuring optimal solar panel orientation throughout the day. Utilized C for Arduino programming and electronic components for circuit design.
